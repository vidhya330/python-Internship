I have joined Elevate Labs as a Python Developer Intern for a duration of 45 days starting from September 22, 2025.

This internship will help me gain practical experience in Python development, Django/Flask frameworks, API integrations, database management, automation scripting, and deployment processes.

At the end of the internship, I will receive a Completion Certificate and a Letter of Recommendation, with the opportunity for a full-time offer based on performance.
